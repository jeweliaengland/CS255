Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Driverpass was a new and upcoming company who wanted students to be able to take driving practice tests and drive times with teachers. They wanted to create a softare where students can schedule this all online. The stuents could create their accounts and  be paired with a teacher based on scheduling. 
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did really well on the buissness requirements document.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
If I could choose one part of my work to improve, I would choose to update some of my uml diagrams. Workig with the free version of lucidchart can be a little frustrating as it does have some limitations. I also could have perfected the design of my charts a little more. 
The user's needs were the most important thing in the system design. I wanted to make sure it had a log in, practice tests, schedule functions, and correct access for each user. This is very important so that the final product functions in a way that is easy to navigate and makes sense. 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I definitely think that planning ahead heavily is very important. I want to make sure that I can get the whole picture defore I actually begin a design. In the future, I will definitely be using UML diagrams to do this.
